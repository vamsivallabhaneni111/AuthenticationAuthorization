Here StocksAndShares.Api.Aum should talk to StocksAndShares.Api.LiquidFunds inorder to get the liquid funds data.

Overall :
StocksAndShares.Api.Client is an userfacing App(just like Groww app).
Client talks to AUM service for the data.

Project Specific :
Aum is a service Api interacting with LiquidFunds Api. So, we use client credentials as GrantType.
